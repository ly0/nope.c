[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/riolet/nope.c.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/riolet/nope.c)

**This branch was abandoned as the origin has been updated which is quite different from mine. Nevertheless I will fork a lastest version with a regular expression module of url routing.**

#nope.c

nope.c is a C language-based ultra-light software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications. Think node.js for C programmers.

Just put your code inside the function `void server(Request request)` in `server.c` and you are good to go.

nope.c can operate in many different configurations, all selected at compile time. They include:


1. Single-threaded (Default) or multi-threaded (make with `THREADS=n` where n>0)

2. Select(Default) or epoll (make with `LOOP=epoll`) based event loop

3. C10K mode (make with `LOOP=epoll MAX_CON_CONS=n` where n>10,000)


Default port is 4242. Set environment variable 'PORT' to change it.

That's really it. The source comes with a simple example `factor.c` to get you started.
